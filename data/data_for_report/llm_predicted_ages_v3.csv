43113,34.0,0.75,"The user's strong desire for a relationship to last 'The rest of my life' and prioritization of 'Love' over 'Sex' are key indicators of someone seeking a committed, long-term partnership. Combined with 'Extremely important' religious belief (Judaism) and a 'Never' drug use stance, this suggests a mature individual likely in their 30s who is serious about finding a stable, values-aligned partner."
4026,31.0,0.75,"The user's atheism, stated 'Not at all important' view on religion, and tolerance for a partner's marijuana use strongly suggest a younger, more modern demographic. However, her desire for a relationship lasting 'The rest of my life' and prioritizing 'Love' over 'Sex' indicates maturity beyond the very early twenties. 'Below average' self-confidence is common across various ages but fits well with someone in their late 20s to early 30s who is seeking a stable, long-term connection."
20893,35.0,0.75,"The user's strong preference for 'Love' over 'Sex' and a desire for a relationship lasting 'Several years' indicate a focus on serious, long-term commitment, often seen in individuals past their early twenties. While personally abstaining from drugs, their tolerance for a partner using 'soft stuff like marijuana' suggests a mature and open-minded perspective, consistent with evolving social norms among middle-aged adults. Their Atheism, combined with average self-confidence and a reserved emotional style, aligns well with a man in his mid-thirties seeking a stable and meaningful connection."
53819,25.0,0.75,"The user seeks a relationship lasting 'a few months to a year,' suggesting an exploratory phase rather than a very short-term or lifelong commitment. This, coupled with an acceptance of soft drug use in a partner and a stated atheist outlook, points towards a younger demographic, most likely in their early to mid-twenties."
15198,31.0,0.75,"The user prioritizes 'Love' and desires a relationship lasting 'Several years,' indicating a mature approach to dating beyond casual encounters. Their atheistic worldview is common among younger adults, while their 'Hesitant, but I'd certainly consider it' stance on meeting and strong aversion to drugs suggest a thoughtful, stable individual, fitting well within the late twenties to mid-thirties demographic."
6988,31.0,0.8,"The user is a woman who prioritizes 'Love' and desires a relationship lasting 'Several years', indicating a focus on meaningful, long-term commitment often seen in the late 20s to early 30s. Her 'Atheism' and 'Not at all important' stance on religion, combined with being open to dating someone who uses 'soft stuff like marijuana', align strongly with the social views prevalent in younger adult generations (Millennials). Her 'Below average' self-confidence and 'Always' being open with feelings are also traits that can be present in this age group as they navigate life and relationships."
8836,30.0,0.75,"The user prioritizes 'Love' and seeks a relationship lasting 'A few months to a year', indicating a desire for a meaningful connection beyond casual encounters but not immediately 'the rest of my life'. This timeframe is common for individuals in their late 20s to early 30s who are serious about dating but also realistic. Their 'Higher than average' self-confidence and willingness to be 'Usually' open with feelings suggest emotional maturity. While they personally 'Never' use drugs, they are open to dating someone who uses 'soft stuff like marijuana', which reflects a blend of personal boundaries and modern open-mindedness often seen in this age group."
16922,38.0,0.75,"The user's strong desire for a relationship to last 'The rest of my life' is a primary indicator, suggesting they are past the exploratory dating phase and seeking a serious, long-term commitment. This goal, combined with 'Love' being more interesting than 'Sex,' being open with feelings, and having 'Higher than average' self-confidence, points towards a mature adult, likely in their mid-to-late thirties or early forties, who is established and ready to settle down. Their 'Atheism' and 'Never' doing drugs are consistent with a stable adult profile."
23338,30.0,0.75,"The user's desire for a relationship lasting 'A few months to a year' is a strong indicator of someone in their late 20s to early 30s, seeking connection without necessarily a long-term commitment. This is further supported by prioritizing 'Love' over 'Sex' and a nuanced stance on drugs (personally abstains but open to partners using soft drugs), suggesting a blend of maturity and modern open-mindedness common in this age group."
51591,31.0,0.75,"The user prioritizes 'Love' and seeks a relationship to last 'The rest of my life,' indicating a strong desire for long-term commitment. This suggests a mature individual, likely past the early stages of dating. Their modern stance on religion ('Not very important') and open-mindedness towards a partner using 'soft stuff like marijuana' (while personally using 'Never') points to an age group that is settled in their values but still relatively young and contemporary, fitting well into the late 20s to early 30s."
54482,39.0,0.75,"The user's strong desire for a relationship lasting 'The rest of my life,' combined with 'Higher than average' self-confidence and being 'Usually' open with feelings, indicates a mature individual seeking commitment. Their continued interest in 'Sex' right now and being 'Totally willing!' to meet in person suggests they are actively engaged in dating, common for someone in their late 30s or early 40s."

This, combined with being 'Totally willing!' to meet, suggests an active, enthusiastic individual past the very casual dating phase but not yet in an age bracket typically seeking immediate 'forever.' These characteristics align well with someone in their late 20s to early 30s.

49417,28.0,0.75,"The user's desire for a lifelong relationship and high willingness to meet suggests a serious dating intent, typically past early 20s. However, their focus on 'Sex' currently (q35), vegetarian/vegan lifestyle (q179268), and lower religious importance (q41) are traits often more prevalent in younger adult demographics.
