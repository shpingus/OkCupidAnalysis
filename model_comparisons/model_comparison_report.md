### Overall Best Model

After analyzing the performance of all four models across multiple metrics, we can see that each model has particular strengths. The **Enhanced Simple Model** achieves the best overall performance with the lowest Mean Absolute Error (5.20 years) and highest R² score (0.1843), showing an 11.76% improvement in explanatory power over the Simple Model. While the **Simple Model** performs better on the accuracy thresholds (±1, ±3, and ±5 years), the differences are relatively small.

The Enhanced K-Fold Model consistently outperforms the regular K-Fold Model across all metrics except MAE, where they are tied. Based on this comprehensive analysis, the **Enhanced Simple Model** is deemed the most effective overall, as it provides the best balance between low error (MAE) and high explanatory power (R²), which are typically considered the most important statistical metrics for regression tasks. This model would be the recommended choice for age prediction tasks where minimizing overall error and maximizing explanatory power are prioritized over accuracy within specific thresholds.
