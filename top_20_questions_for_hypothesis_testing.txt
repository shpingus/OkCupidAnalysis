Statistical Test Framework:
1. Define hypotheses (H0 and H1)
2. Specify null distribution
3. Design experiment/analysis
4. Calculate p-value
5. Reject or fail to reject null hypothesis

Age Group Considerations:
  - Young adults (18-25)
  - Adults (26-35)
  - Middle-aged (36-50)
  - Older adults (50+)

Potential Statistical Tests:
  - Chi-square test (categorical responses)
  - ANOVA (comparing means across age groups)
  - Correlation analysis (age as continuous variable)
  - Logistic regression (binary outcomes)
